What? What's going on?


  
It's Marty He's gone

Oh no! What are we going to do?

the way to Connecticut and we need


  
 Hello? Hello?

They'll be really mad


  
It'll get Marty transferred for good
Don't bite the hand that feeds you


  
I know that's right


  
 We got to go after him
 Go after him?


  
He's not thinking straight


  
Let's stop him from making
the biggest mistake of his life


  
He's probably out there
lost and cold confused


  
Poor little guy


  
Come on


  
One of us should wait here
in case he comes back


  
Not now This is an intervention
We all got to go


  
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?


  
 You should take Lexington
 Melman!


  
 Okay We We should take Lexington

No Park goes two ways
You can't time the lights


  
I heard Tom Wolfe
is speaking at Lincoln Center


  
Well of course

We should've taken Park


  
You sure this is the fastest way
to Grand Central Station?


  
I don't know! That's what Melman said


  
Hey Hey you guys


  
That room has some nifty little sinks
you can wash up in and look!


  
Free mints!


  
This isn't a field trip


  
This is an urgent mission to save Marty
from throwing his life away


  
Now where's the train?


  
Here it comes


  
What did Marty say to you?
I asked you to talk to him


  
I did! I did! I don't understand
He said let's go


  
I said are you crazy?
He says I'm ten years old


  
And he has blackandwhite stripes
and so then we sang and


  
What you got to do is go straight back
down West nd


  
 It's on your left after Vanderbilt
 Okay


  
If you hit the Chrysler Building

Because we've been sitting
on that beach back there for hours


  
and nobody's even bothered to show up


  
I don't know how things
are normally run around here


  
but there's been some sort
of major screwup which is cool


  
So if you could point us towards
the administrative offices we'll

Nonsense Maurice


  
Come on everybody
Let's go and meet the pansies!


  
Presenting your royal highness
our illustrious King Julien XIII


  
selfproclaimed lord of the lemurs

king of the guinea pigs?


  
I think it's a squirrel


  
Welcome giant pansies


  
Please feel free to bask in my glow


  
 Definitely a squirrel
 Yep Squirrel


  
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the foosa


  
 The whossa?
 The foosa


  
They annoy us by trespassing
interrupting our parties


  
 And ripping our limbs off
 Good


  
We're just trying to find out
where the people are so


  
What big teeth you have Man!


  
Shame on you Maurice


  
Can you not see
that you have insulted the freak?


  
You must tell me
who the heck are you?


  
I'm Alex The Alex
And this is Gloria Marty and Melman


  
And just where are you giants from?


  
We're from New York and


  
 All hail the New York giants!
 New York giants!


  
Is this some sort of
inbreeding program?


  
I say we just got to ask these bozos
where the people are


  
Excuse me
We bozos have the people of course


  
Hey the bozos have the people


  
Oh well great Good Phew


  
They're up there


  
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch though


  
So do you have any live people?


  
No Only dead ones


  
I mean
if we had a lot of live people here


  
it wouldn't be called the wild
would it?


  
 The wild?
 Whoa


  
Hold up there a second fuzzbucket


  
You mean like


  
the live in a mud hut
wipe yourself with a leaf type wild?


  
 Who wipes?

Could you excuse me for a moment?


  
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!


  
 Help!
 What are you doing?


  
I'm swimming back to New York


  
I know my chances are slim
but I have to try!


  
 You can't swim!
 I said my chances are slim!


  
Nature! It's all over me! Get it off!
I can't see! I can't see!


  
I can see!


  
Look There's obviously
just been a little mistake


  
The people didn't dump us here
on purpose


  
As soon as they realize what happened
they'll come looking for us right?


  
Yeah right


  
I don't know the words
but we're born free


  
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way


  
Well boys it's going to be
icecold sushi for breakfast


  
Rico


  
Well since I'm doomed to die
on this forsaken island


  
I Melman Mankiewicz


  
being of sound mind and unsound body


  
have divided my estate equally
among the three of you


  
Sorry Alex


  
Hey! A latrine Nice work Melman
Outdoor plumbing


  
No it's not a latrine
It's a grave


  
You sent Melman to his grave
Are you happy?


  
Come on


  
This isn't the end
This is a whole new beginning


  
This could be the best
that's happened


  
No No No No
No No No No No No


  
This is not the best thing
that's happened to us


  
You abused the power
of the birthday wish


  
and brought bad luck
on all of us


  
Why'd you tell your wish?
You're not supposed to


  
I didn't want to tell you
Remember?


  
 You guys made me tell you
 Oh okay


  
Besides this isn't bad luck
This is good luck


  
Look around
There's no fences no schedules


  
This place is beautiful
Baby we were born


  
Okay Okay
I've had enough of this


  
This is your side of the island
and this is our side of the island


  
That is the bad side
where you can prance and skip


  
like a magical pixie horse
and do whatever the heck you want


  
This is the good side
for those who love New York


  
and care about going home


  
 Come on
 No no Back! Back!


  
You know what? This isn't good


  
Okay! You all have your side
and I'll have mine


  
And if you need me
I'll be over here


  
on the fun side of the island
having a good old time


  
This is the fun side


  
where we'll have a great time
surviving until we go home


  
 A yabbadabbado old time!
 This side's the best


  
That side stinks!


  
You're on the Jersey side
of this cesspool!


  
 Wilma!
 Now what do we do?


  
Don't worry
I have a plan to get us rescued


  
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this


  
Just look at him
He's helpless without us


  
Shut up Spalding


  
I've been standing here for hours man
How long do I have to pose like this?


  
She is finito


  
I defy any rescue boat
within a million miles


  
to miss this baby


  
When the moment is right
we will ignite the beacon of liberty


  
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!


  
What do you think?
Pretty cool huh?


  
 How's the liberty fire going Melman?
 Great Idiot


  
I heard that


  
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?


  
That's wild fire


  
We're not using wild fire
on Lady Liberty


  
 Now rub Melman
 I've been doing


  
I can't I can't I can't do it
I ju I can't do it!


  
Fire


  
Fire


  
Fire! Fire!


  
Oh my


  
Fire!


  
Not yet! No no! No!


  
Fire!


  
Melman hold still!


  
Jump! Alex jump!


  
Don't worry
cats always land on their


  
Face?
Man what kind of cat are you?


  
You maniac!


  
You burned it up! Darn you!


  
Darn you all to heck!


  
Can we go to the fun side now?


  
Everybody calm down Come on
Into your chairs


  
Everybody calm down
Let go of his tail


  
Separate those two
would you please?


  
You here you there Everyone


  
Calm down people okay?


  
Now presenting your royal highness
the illustrious blah blah blah


  
You know et cetera et cetera
Hooray Let's go


  
Now everybody


  
we all have great curiosity
about our guests the New York giants


  
 Yes Willie?
 I like them


  
I like them I liked them first
Before I even met them I liked them


  
I liked them right away


  
You hate them
compared to how much I like them


  
Oh shut up You're so annoying!


  
Now for as long as we can remember


  
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded foosa


  
The foosa! The foosa are attacking!


  
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!


  
Please Maurice


  
Quiet!


  
Come on y'all They're not attacking us
this very instant


  
So my genius plan is this


  
We will make the New York giants
our friends and keep them close


  
Then with Mr Alex protecting us
we will be safe


  
and never have to worry
about the dreaded foosa ever again


  
I thought of that I thought of that
Yes Me I did


  
Hold on everybody Hold on
I'm just thinking now


  
I mean
does anyone wonder why the foosa


  
were so scared of Mr Alex?


  
I mean
maybe we should be scared too


  
What if Mr Alex
is even worse than the foosa?


  
I tell you that dude
just gives me the heebiedabajeebies


  
Maurice you did not raise your hand


  
Therefore your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record


  
Does anyone else
have the heebiejeebies?


  
No? Good So shut up


  
When the New York giants wake up


  
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise


  
Now who would like a cookie?


  
Yo Al Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time


  
There's room on the fun side
for one more


  
No thanks


  
Look I've been thinking
Maybe if you gave this place a chance


  
I don't know
you might even enjoy yourself


  
Marty I'm tired I'm hungry


  
I just want to go home


  
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it


  
It really isn't the fun side
without you


  
I know And then


  
 It's him
 Who is it?


  
It's the pizza man
Who the heck do you think it is?


  
Yes? Can I help you?


  
Can I come to the fun side?


  
Beg your pardon?


  
You know I've been kind of a jerk


  
But I've been thinking
about what you said and I'm sorry


  
Welcome to Casa del Wild
Take a load off


  
Hey hey wipe your feet


  
 Alex!
 Mi casa is su casa


  
Very impressive


  
Hey have a drink
It's on the house


  
This is seawater


  
Oh you don't swallow it


  
It's just temporary
till the plumbing's done


  
Hey y'all look hungry


  
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?


  
You have food?


  
The Fun Side Special coming up


  
Seaweed on a stick


  
Seaweed?


  
On a stick
Don't love it till you try it


  
That's unbelievable


  
 So good

It does kind of hit the spot

Well maybe it could use
a little lemon


  
No it's great It's really great
Doesn't get any better than this


  
Oh but it does


  
Check this out


  
Would you look at that


  
It's like billions and billions
of helicopters


  
It's a shooting star
Make a wish Quick!


  
How about a thick juicy steak?


  
You know what Alex?


  
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me


  
Thanks Marty


  
It is getting late

I think I'm going to hit
the sack too


  
Sweet dreams everyone


  
Alex


  
What are you doing?


  
Twentyseven  
Thirty black and only  white


  
Looks like you're black with white
stripes after all


  
Dilemma solved Good night


  
You see Maurice
Mr Alex was grooming his friend


  
He is clearly a tender loving thing


  
How can you have the heebiejeebies
for Mr Alex?


  
Look at him

I don't think he was grooming him


  
Look more like
he was tasting him to me


  
Suit yourself no matter
I don't care


  
Soon we will put
my excellent plan to action


  
All we have to do is wait
until they are deep in their sleep


  
How long is this going to take?


  
Well this sucks!


  
Wake up Mr Alex


  
Wake up Mr Alex

As long as we're together
it doesn't matter to me


  
Well in that case


  
Yo Rico I'll take  orders to go


  
But before you leave
I have an announcement to make


  
So shut up everyone please
Thank you


  
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head


  
I have decided to thank you
for bringing peace to our home


  
And to make you feel good


  
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift


  
No I couldn't
Really I can't take your crown


  
That's okay I've got a bigger crown


  
It's got a gecko on it


  
Look at him shake Go Stevie go!


  
 Bye little fuzzbuckets!
 Thanks for everything!


  
 So long!
 Byebye now


  
 Arrivederci
 Byebye


  
 Toodleoo!
 See you later crocodile


  
Maurice my arm is tired
Wave it for me


  
Faster you naughty little monkey


  
By the time we get back to New York
it'll be the middle of winter


  
So I was just thinking why rush?


  
Maybe we could make
a few side stops along the way


  
 Maybe Paris
 You just read my mind


  
 I was thinking Spain
 Run with the bulls


  
 What about Fiji?
 Canada Can we?


  
Cheap meds


  
I wouldn't even mind
coming back here sometime


  
 I could do that
 You could say that again


  
 Skipper?
 I always wanted to go to Australia


  
Don't you think we should tell them
that the boat's out of gas?


  
Nah Just smile and wave boys
Smile and wave
